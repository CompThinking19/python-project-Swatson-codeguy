I choose to do a project on aliens and not some big problem in the world because, I feel like the world takes its self too serious and needs to take a break and think about our neighbors in sear by galaxies. I did this by importing the csv file of the data of UFO sighting in all 50 states.The user would be presented a tab that has all 50 states and they would select the state they are in after they hit submit an 8 bit version of the omnitirx from the show Ben 10
would display they percentage of people who have seen aliens out of 100,000 people. The objective of this dictionary is to iterate through the set of information from the csv file that came from sateillitaeinternet.com. During this project some challenges that I faced were finding a useable list of information for UFO sightings in the US but something else that caused me a problem was figuring out  how to make the program take the csv information and the ability for me to access it.
But after I figured out how to do those things the only I had to look up how to do was how to take user input.Things that I would continue on this project is to figure out how to make the 8 or 16 bit omnitirx and make the watch do an animation when it is clicked on but that seems like what were learning how to do in java script, overall this was a awesome project and a great class.
