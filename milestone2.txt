Unfortunately, your code didn't run due to an indent error, but I get a sense of what you're trying to do with it from looking at what you've written. I do have a concern about the interactivity of the piece: right now you take the user's state but then don't do anything with it. Why not use that to pull data out of the dataset you're looking at, for example? It's just hard for me to figure out exactly what the piece is doing that you can't get from a google search at this point. You have some interesting data, and you're doing well to get it into your program, but I think it would be good to do more than just print it to the screen.
