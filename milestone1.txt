You have a really good opening set of comments about the overall arc of the program, which is excellent since this is one of the primary goals of this milestone. The rest of the code still feels fairly tentative. Your next step should be getting the CSV file into the code and playing with it: you import the CSV module, but you don't yet import the file with the data in it. Focus on getting that into your program and you can start playing with the data. I am still a bit concerned about the overall sweep of the project, and this is something we can discuss in person: I'm not sure how putting this data in a program is engaging something larger than itself yet.
